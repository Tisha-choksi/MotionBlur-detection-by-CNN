# MotionBlur-detection-by-CNN

Overview
The MotionBlur-detection-by-CNN project aims to detect motion blur in images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This repository includes the implementation of a deep learning model that classifies images as either blurred or sharp, specifically focusing on motion blur caused by camera shake or object movement.
